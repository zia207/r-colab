        "## Core Concepts of Functional Programming\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Pure Functions**:\n",
        "    -   A pure function is a function that, given the same input, always produces the same output and has no side effects (e.g., it doesn’t modify external state, like variables outside its scope, or perform I/O operations).\n",
        "    -   Example: A function that calculates the square of a number, like `square(5) => 25`, is pure because it always returns the same result for the same input and doesn’t affect anything else.\n",
        "    -   Impure example: A function that reads from a file or modifies a global variable is not pure because its output or behavior depends on external state.\n",
        "2.  **Immutability**:\n",
        "    -   In FP, data is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once created. Instead of modifying data, you create new data structures with updated values.\n",
        "    -   Example: In JavaScript, instead of mutating an array with `push`, you might use `concat` to return a new array: `[1, 2].concat([3]) => [1, 2, 3]`, leaving the original array unchanged.\n",
        "    -   This avoids bugs caused by unexpected changes to shared data.\n",
        "3.  **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**:\n",
        "    -   Functions in FP are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.\n",
        "    -   Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them. Example: The `map` function in JavaScript, which applies a function to each element of an array: `[1, 2, 3].map(x => x * 2) => [2, 4, 6]`.\n",
        "4.  **Declarative Over Imperative**:\n",
        "    -   FP favors a declarative style, where you describe *what* the program should do, not *how* to do it step-by-step (imperative).\n",
        "    -   Example: To sum an array, FP uses `reduce` (declarative: `[1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)`) instead of a loop that explicitly iterates and updates a sum variable (imperative).\n",
        "5.  **Avoiding Side Effects**:\n",
        "    -   Side effects are changes to the program’s state or interactions with the outside world (e.g., modifying global variables, writing to a database, or logging to the console). FP minimizes side effects to make code predictable and easier to reason about.\n",
        "    -   Example: Instead of printing results inside a function, return the result and let the caller handle output.\n",
        "6.  **Function Composition**:\n",
        "    -   FP encourages combining simple, pure functions to build complex logic, much like composing mathematical functions (e.g., `f(g(x))`).\n",
        "    -   Example: If you have a function `double(x)` and `addOne(x)`, you can compose them to create a new function: `compose(double, addOne)(5) => double(addOne(5)) => double(6) => 12`.\n",
        "7.  **Referential Transparency**:\n",
        "    -   An expression is referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its value without changing the program’s behavior. Pure functions are referentially transparent.\n",
        "    -   Example: If `square(4)` always returns `16`, you can replace `square(4)` with `16` anywhere in the code without affecting the outcome."

        "\n",
        "-   **Recursion Over Loops**: FP often uses recursion instead of loops for iteration, as loops often rely on mutable state. For example, to process a list, you might use a recursive function that processes the head and tail of the list.\n",
        "-   **Lazy Evaluation**: Some FP languages (like Haskell) delay evaluating expressions until their results are needed, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.\n",

        "2.  **Modularity**: Small, reusable functions and function composition lead to modular, maintainable code.\n",
        "3.  **Testability**: Pure functions are easy to test because they don’t depend on external state—just inputs and outputs.\n",
        "4.  **Concurrency**: Immutability eliminates issues like race conditions in concurrent or parallel programming, as data cannot be modified by multiple threads.\n",
        "5.  **Debugging**: Fewer side effects mean fewer sources of bugs, and referential transparency makes it easier to understand code behavior."
