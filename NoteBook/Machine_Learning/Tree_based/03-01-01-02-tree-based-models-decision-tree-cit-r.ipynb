        "Conditional Inference Trees (CITs) are a type of decision tree algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. Unlike traditional decision trees (e.g., CART), CITs are designed to reduce bias in variable selection and overfitting by using a statistical framework based on conditional inference. They rely on hypothesis testing to select splits, ensuring that the splitting process is statistically sound. Below, I explain how CITs work for classification and regression problems, detailing each step with the necessary mathematical foundations.\n",

        "\n",
        "-   `Null Hypothesis` ($H_0$): The predictor $X_j$ and the response $Y$ are independent, i.e., the distribution of $Y$ does not depend on $X_j$.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `Alternative Hypothesis` ($H_1$): There is a dependence between $X_j$ and $Y$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The test statistic is based on the association between $X_j$ and $Y$. The choice of test statistic depends on the type of response variable:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `Classification`: For a categorical response $Y$ with $K$ classes, a common choice is a permutation test based on the chi-squared statistic or a linear statistic derived from the conditional distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `Regression`: For a continuous response `Y`, a linear statistic (e.g., based on the correlation between $X_j$ and $Y$ or a test like the ANOVA F-test is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "The test statistic is computed as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Let $\\mathbf{X} = (X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p)$ be the $p$ predictor variables, and $Y$ be the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   For a predictor $X_j$, the algorithm computes a test statistic $T_j$ that measures the association between $X_j$ and $Y$.\n",

        "4. Recursive Partitioning\n",

        "-   The maximum tree depth is reached (optional, user-specified).\n",

        "\n",
        "Conditional Inference Trees (CIT) are an advanced type of decision tree that use statistical tests to select splits, reducing bias toward features with many possible splits (unlike CART, which uses Gini or MSE). Implementing CIT from scratch in R without packages is complex due to the need for statistical tests (e.g., permutation tests) for split selection. Since you previously requested no R packages for CART and encountered issues with the Boston Housing and Iris datasets, I’ll provide a simplified implementation of CIT in base R, focusing on core concepts while maintaining compatibility with your prior context (classification on Iris, regression on Boston Housing)."

It provides a comprehensive framework for building Conditional Inference Trees (CITs) and other tree-based methods, allowing users to fit, manipulate, visualize, and analyze decision trees effectively. Below is a concise list of the primary functions in {partykit}, based on its core functionality:\n",

        "## Summary and Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditional Inference Trees (CITs) are a powerful and flexible tool for both classification and regression tasks. They offer several advantages over traditional decision trees, including unbiased variable selection, statistical rigor, and the ability to handle mixed data types. The implementation of CITs in R using the {partykit} package allows for easy fitting, pruning, and visualization of trees. The CIT algorithm is particularly useful in scenarios where unbiased variable selection and robust stopping criteria are essential, such as in medical or social science applications. In this tutorial we demonstrated how to implement CITs for both classification and regression tasks using the {partykit} package in R.\n"
