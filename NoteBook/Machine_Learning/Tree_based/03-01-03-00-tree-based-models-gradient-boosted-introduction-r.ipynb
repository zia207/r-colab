        "\n",
        "GBT builds an ensemble of decision trees in a **sequential** manner, unlike bagging methods (e.g., Random Forest), which build trees independently. The core idea is to iteratively improve predictions by fitting new trees to the residuals (errors) of the previous model, guided by gradient descent to minimize a specified loss function.\n",

        "\n",
        "-   Train a new decision tree to predict the residuals. The tree is typically shallow (e.g., limited depth) to prevent overfitting.\n",
