        "\n",
        "Distance-based machine learning models rely on the concept of measuring the \"distance\" or similarity between data points to make predictions or classifications. These models assume that similar data points (those closer in some metric space) are likely to share the same label or behavior. They are commonly used in tasks like classification, clustering, and regression, and they leverage distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or cosine similarity to quantify relationships between data points."

Instead, they rely on the geometry of the data points, making them intuitive and effective for many tasks, especially when the data has clear spatial patterns. Common applications include pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems."

        "1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:\n",
        "\n",
        "KNN is a simple, non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. For a given data point, it finds the $k$ closest data points (neighbors) based on a distance metric (typically Euclidean) and makes a prediction based on their labels (classification) or values (regression).\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **How It Works**:\n",
        "     - Compute the distance between the test point and all training points.\n",
        "     - Select the $k$ nearest neighbors.\n",
        "     - For classification, assign the most common label among the neighbors (majority voting).\n",
        "     - For regression, compute the average (or weighted average) of the neighbors’ values.\n",
        "     \n",
        "   - **Key Features**:\n",
        "     - Lazy learning: No explicit training phase; stores the entire dataset.\n",
        "     - Sensitive to the choice of $k$ and the distance metric.\n",
        "     - Works well for small datasets but can be computationally expensive for large ones.\n",
        "   - **Applications**: Image classification, recommendation systems, anomaly detection.\n",
        "   \n",

        "2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Kernel Trick**:\n",
        "\n",
        "While SVMs are not purely distance-based, they can be considered distance-based when using kernel functions that implicitly rely on distance metrics (e.g., Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel). SVMs aim to find a hyperplane that best separates classes by maximizing the margin (distance) between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (support vectors).\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **How It Works**:\n",
        "     - For non-linearly separable data, the kernel trick maps data to a higher-dimensional space where a linear boundary can be found.\n",
        "     - The RBF kernel, for example, uses a Gaussian function based on Euclidean distance to measure similarity between points.\n",
        "         - The model optimizes the margin while minimizing classification errors.\n",

        "     - Core points (within $\\epsilon$ of at least $MinPts$ points) form the basis of clusters.\n",
        "     - Border points are within $\\epsilon$ of a core point but don’t meet the $MinPts$ criterion.\n",
        "     - Points not assigned to any cluster are considered noise.\n",
