It is built on Jupyter Notebook and offers a free, convenient, and collaborative environment for data analysis, machine learning, and general-purpose Python programming. Colab allows you to create and share Jupyter notebooks that include code, text, images, and visualizations.\n",

        "5.  **Pre-installed Libraries:** Many popular Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch) come pre-installed on Colab, reducing setup time.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Easy Sharing:** Colab notebooks can be easily shared with others by generating a shareable link. It's a convenient way to showcase your work or collaborate with"
