        "**Descriptive Statistics** is a field that assists in describing and summarizing data. It encompasses `mean`, `median`, `mode`, `range`, `variance`, and `standard deviation` metrics. These measures provide researchers with a clear idea of the `central tendency` and dispersion of the data, thereby serving as a concise summary of the data. Calculating and analyzing the mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation metrics are fundamental concepts in descriptive statistics. These measures help researchers make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions by better understanding the data's central tendency and dispersion. Descriptive statistics can also identify patterns, trends, and outliers that might be difficult to identify otherwise by providing a concise data summary.\n",

It is particularly useful when analyzing categorical data, or when identifying the most common occurrence within a set of values. A data set can have one mode, or more than one mode if there are multiple values that occur with equal frequency (known as bimodal, trimodal, etc.).
