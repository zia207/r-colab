Zero-Inflated Models\n","\n","When analyzing count data, you may encounter datasets with excessive zeros. For example, a study on the number of doctor visits might have many individuals who reported zero visits in a given period. Traditional Poisson or negative binomial models struggle to handle this \"zero inflation,\" often leading to poor fit and biased predictions. Zero-inflated models, such as the Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) and Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB), address this issue by modeling the excess zeros separately from the count process.\n","\n","This tutorial introduces zero-inflated models in R, focusing on the ZIP and ZINB models. We'll start with an overview of these models, explaining how they account for excess zeros in count data. Then, we'll fit both models from scratch to understand their components, and we'll use the {pscl} package in R to streamline model fitting. Finally, we'll compare these models and evaluate prediction performance using test data to select the best-performing model.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"gvHJcvt40GUr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Overview\n","**Zero-inflated models** are statistical models designed to analyze count data with an excess of zeroes. These models are particularly useful when a dataset has more zero counts than would be expected under traditional count models like `Poisson` or `Negative Binomial distributions`. They are commonly used in fields like ecology, healthcare, economics, and social sciences, where it’s common to observe many zero values alongside non-zero counts.\n","\n","***Why Use Zero-Inflated Models?***\n","\n","In some datasets, zero counts occur so frequently that traditional count models (e.g., Poisson) fail to provide an accurate fit. Zero inflation can arise due to two types of zeroes:\n","\n","1. **Structural Zeroes**: These occur because some units in the data have no chance of experiencing the event of interest. For example, in a survey on smoking habits, non-smokers will have a structural zero count for cigarette consumption.\n","\n","2. **Sampling Zeroes**: These are regular zeroes that occur naturally in the data as part of the random process. For example, even smokers may occasionally have a zero count for the number of cigarettes smoked on a particular day.\n","\n","Zero-inflated models account for both types by combining two processes:\n","\n","- A **binary model** (often logistic regression) that models the probability of a structural zero.\n","\n","- A **count model** (often Poisson or Negative Binomial) for the non-zero counts.\n","\n","***How Zero-Inflated Models Work***\n","\n","Zero-inflated models typically involve two components:\n","\n","1. **Zero-inflation Component**: This component models the probability of an observation being in the \"always-zero\" group, using a logistic (or similar) regression model.\n","\n","2. **Count Component**: This component models the count for non-zero values using either a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution.\n","\n","The two most common types of zero-inflated models are:\n","\n","- **Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP)**: Assumes that the non-zero counts follow a Poisson distribution. Used when data do not exhibit overdispersion (variance ≈ mean).\n","\n","- **Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB)**: Assumes that non-zero counts follow a Negative Binomial distribution. Used when data exhibit overdispersion (variance > mean).\n","\n","\n","For a zero-inflated model, the probability of observing a count \\( Y = y \\) is given by:\n","\n","$$ P(Y = y) =\n","\\begin{cases}\n","      \\pi + (1 - \\pi) \\cdot P(Y = 0 \\,|\\, \\text{Count Model}) & \\text{if } y = 0, \\\\\n","      (1 - \\pi) \\cdot P(Y = y \\,|\\, \\text{Count Model}) & \\text{if } y > 0.\n","\\end{cases} $$\n","\n","where:\n","\n","- $\\pi$ is the probability that an observation is in the `structural zero` state.\n","\n","- $P(Y = y \\,|\\, \\text{Count Model})$ represents the probability of observing count \\( y \\) under a `Poisson` or `Negative Binomial model`.\n","\n","***When to Use Zero-Inflated Models***\n","\n","Zero-inflated models are suitable when:\n","\n","- **Data have an excess of zeroes** that cannot be explained by standard Poisson or Negative Binomial models.\n","\n","- **Two distinct processes** are likely at play: one that generates structural zeroes and another that generates counts (including zeroes).\n","\n","- The data may be **overdispersed** (in the case of ZINB).\n","\n","***Examples of Zero-Inflated Models in Use***\n","\n","1. **Healthcare**: Modeling the frequency of hospital visits, where some individuals never require a visit (structural zeroes) and others may have occasional visits.\n","2. **Ecology**: Modeling species count data in different regions where certain areas may not support the species at all (structural zeroes) and others may support varying counts.\n","3. **Economics**: Modeling loan defaults, where some individuals are unlikely to default at all (structural zeroes), while others have a probability of defaulting.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RkAjoIhZP50J"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Install
