The GLM was first introduced by Sir John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn, both acclaimed statisticians, in 1972.\n",

It allows for modeling non-normal distributions, non-linear relationships, and correlations between observations. By utilizing **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)**, the GLM can also handle missing data and provide accurate estimates even when some observations are missing. This makes it a valuable tool in business and academia, where the ability to model complex relationships accurately is essential.\n",

        "## Key features of Generalized Linear Models\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Link Function:** GLMs are characterized by a **link function** that connects the linear predictor, a combination of independent variables, to the mean of the dependent variable. This connection enables the estimation of the relationship between independent and dependent variables in a non-linear fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "The selection of a link function in GLMs is contingent upon the nature of the data and the distribution of the response variable. The `identity` link function is utilized when the continuous response variable follows a normal distribution. The `logit` link function is employed when the response variable is binary, meaning it can only take on two values and follows a binomial distribution. The `log` link function is utilized when the response variable is count data and follows a Poisson distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Choosing an appropriate link function is a crucial aspect of modeling, as it impacts the interpretation of the estimated coefficients for independent variables. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the nature of the data and the response variable's distribution is necessary when selecting a link function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Distribution Family:** Unlike linear regression, which assumes a normal distribution for the residuals, GLMs allow for a variety of probability distributions for the response variable. The choice of distribution is based on the characteristics of the data. Commonly used distributions include:\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **Normal distribution (Gaussian):** For continuous data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **Binomial distribution:** For binary or dichotomous data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **Poisson distribution:** For count data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **Gamma distribution:** For continuous, positive, skewed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Variance Function:** GLMs accommodate heteroscedasticity (unequal variances across levels of the independent variables) by allowing the variance of the response variable to be a function of the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Deviance:** Instead of using the sum of squared residuals as in linear regression, GLMs use deviance to measure lack of fit. Deviance compares the fit of the model to a saturated model (a model that perfectly fits the data).\n",
        "\n",
        "The **mathematical expression** of a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) involves the linear predictor, the link function, and the probability distribution of the response variable.\n",

        "\n",
        "-   **LM (Linear Model)**: Assumes that the response variable is continuous and normally distributed. For example, predicting a continuous variable like height or weight.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. **Link Function**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **LM**: The relationship between the predictor variables and the response is assumed to be linear, with an identity link function (i.e., ($Y = X \\beta + \\epsilon$), where ($\\epsilon$) is normally distributed).\n",
        "-   **GLM**: Uses a link function to transform the linear predictor to accommodate different types of response variables. Common link functions include:\n",
        "    -   **Logit link** for binary data (logistic regression)\n",
        "    -   **Log link** for count data (Poisson regression)\n",

        "\n",
        "-   **LM**: Assumes errors are normally distributed with constant variance (homoscedasticity).\n",
        "-   **GLM**: Allows for different error distributions (e.g., binomial, Poisson, gamma) to better suit the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Use Cases**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **LM**: Used when the response variable is continuous, normally distributed, and has a linear relationship with predictors.\n",
        "-   **GLM**: Used when the response variable does not fit these assumptions, such as binary outcomes (yes/no), counts, or proportions.\n",
